# How AgraSense Was Born: From BoilerMake to Reality

AgraSense began its journey at [BoilerMake](https://boilermake.org), Purdue University’s flagship hackathon, in February 2025. Over more than 36 hours of intensive development and teamwork, our project stood out among over 100 competing teams and finished in the top 8 finalists.

## Highlights

* Conceived and prototyped AgraSense in less than two days
* Developed a proof-of-concept IoT sensor mesh for agriculture
* Built the foundations of what would become our current product

Our BoilerMake experience was the spark that launched AgraSense on its mission to bring innovation to modern agriculture.

# Building AgraSense: Collaboration & Innovation at Purdue

After BoilerMake, we continued developing AgraSense at Purdue University, collaborating with Professor Gustavo Rodriguez-Rivera from Computer Science. His guidance and feedback played a vital role in helping us grow from a hackathon prototype to a scalable, real-world platform.

## Key Steps

* Collaborated with Purdue faculty and utilized campus resources
* Improved our ESP32 sensor mesh and data collection software
* Designed dashboards for visualizing farm data

This phase marked AgraSense's transition from concept to functional product, leveraging Purdue’s environment for innovation.

# Field Deployment: AgraSense Partners with Indiana Soybean Alliance

In Spring 2025, AgraSense deployed its sensor mesh at the Indiana Soybean Alliance facility in Tippecanoe County. This was our first opportunity to test the platform under real farming conditions and gather actionable data for growers.

## What We Did

* Installed relay nodes and sensors across active soybean fields
* Monitored soil moisture, temperature, and light levels
* Delivered data and insights to both farmers and researchers

The success of this deployment demonstrated the practical value of AgraSense in everyday agriculture.

# Spreading the Word: AgraSense at Purdue’s Ag Expo

In May 2025, AgraSense participated in Purdue University’s Ag Expo, sharing our progress and technology with farmers, agtech companies, and researchers from across the Midwest.

## At the Expo

* Showcased our sensor platform and live data dashboard
* Connected with potential partners and industry experts
* Received valuable feedback to guide future development

Our presence at Ag Expo helped build awareness and momentum for AgraSense as we continue to grow and innovate.
